# Privacy Policy for AlphasineAssistant

## Introduction

[AlphasineAssistant](https://github.com/alphasine/AlphasineAssistant) is an open-source AI web automation tool that runs in your browser as a Chrome extension. This Privacy Policy explains how AlphasineAssistant handles your data and protects your privacy.

## Open Source and Transparent

AlphasineAssistant is an open-source project licensed under the Apache License 2.0. All source code is publicly available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alphasine/AlphasineAssistant), ensuring complete transparency in how the application functions and processes data.

## Data Handling

### Local Data Storage

- AlphasineAssistant operates entirely within your browser as a Chrome extension.
- No user data is collected, stored, or processed by AlphasineAssistant developers.
- All your data, including settings, API keys, and conversation history, is stored locally on your device.

### Data Sent to LLM Providers

- When using AlphasineAssistant's AI features, web page data (including screenshots and HTML content) are sent directly to the large language model (LLM) provider you have chosen.
- This data is processed by the LLM provider to generate responses and perform automation tasks.
- We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of your chosen LLM provider to understand how they handle your data.

## API Keys

- AlphasineAssistant requires you to provide your own API keys for LLM providers.
- These API keys are stored locally in your browser and are never transmitted to AlphasineAssistant servers.
- You have full control over your API keys and can revoke them at any time.

## User Control

- You have complete control over your data within AlphasineAssistant.
- You can clear your conversation history, delete your settings, and manage your API keys at any time.
- Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the extension will permanently delete all your data.
